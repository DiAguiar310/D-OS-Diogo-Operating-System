# D-OS-Diogo-Operating-System
D'OS (Diogo Operating System) is an open-source, browser-based project that simulates the look and feel of a graphical Operating System (OS). It was originally created as a complement for a research presentation about programming concepts such as APIs, multitasking, memory models, user interfaces, and event-driven programming.
