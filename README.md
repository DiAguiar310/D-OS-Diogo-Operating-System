📌 D'OS – Diogo Operating System

D'OS (Diogo Operating System) is an open-source, browser-based project that simulates the look and feel of a graphical Operating System (OS).
It was originally created as a complement for a research presentation about programming concepts such as APIs, multitasking, memory models, user interfaces, and event-driven programming.

🚀 Features: 🖥️ Desktop Environment with draggable windows and interactive icons 🌗 Light & Dark Mode toggle 🖼️ Wallpaper Management – default wallpapers + custom upload support ⏰ Taskbar with real-time clock and system icons (Wi-Fi, audio, logo) 📂 Start Menu with submenu navigation and settings 🔍 Information windows explaining key programming concepts:

APIs
Memory Models
Multitasking
Windows (GUI concept)
Events & Event Queues
User Interfaces
Advantages of a Graphical OS

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – structure
CSS3 – styling (including dark/light themes, tooltips, and animations)
JavaScript (ES6) – interactivity, drag & drop system, wallpaper manager, system info detection

📖 Purpose
This project was developed as part of an academic research assignment to illustrate core programming and operating system concepts in a practical, interactive way.
Instead of just presenting theory, D'OS demonstrates how these ideas can be visualized inside a simulated OS environment running directly in the browser.
